  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>The flour tortilla is a variant of the corn tortilla. The word 
    tortilla comes from Spanish meaning "small cake". The oldest found 
    tortillas date back as far as 10,000 years BCE and were made of 
    native maize with dried kernels. The corn tortilla was the principal 
    food of the Aztecs and other Mesoamerican civilizations. The flour 
    tortilla is a much more recent invention.
  </p>
  <p>It is said by some that flour tortillas originated in the northern 
    Mexican states of Chihuahua, Durango, Sonora and Sinaloa, where the 
    territory is more suited to growing wheat than corn. In recent times, 
    they have become integral to Mexican American (most notably in the 
    form of a burrito), Mexican—and Tex-Mex—cuisine. Mexican Americans 
    talk about the flour tortilla having come from the wheat-filled plenty 
    of the United States. Most often it is attributed to Alta California 
    when California was still part of the Mexican Republic. Most 
    specifically, it is credited to regions of Northern & Central 
    California with the first mass produced flour tortillas having come 
    from flour tortilla factories in metropolitan Los Angeles. Some have 
    even attributed the origin of flour tortillas to Jewish immigrants of 
    the United States.

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>2 Tbps lard</li>
    <li>1.5 cups water</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Whisk the flour, salt, and baking powder together in a mixing bowl.
       Mix in the lard with your fingers until the flour resembles cornmeal.
        Add the water and mix until the dough comes together; place on a 
        lightly floured surface and knead a few minutes until smooth and 
        elastic. Divide the dough into 24 equal pieces and roll each piece 
        into a ball.
    </li>
    <li>Preheat a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
      Use a well-floured rolling pin to roll a dough ball into a thin, 
      round tortilla. Place into the hot skillet, and cook until bubbly 
      and golden; flip and continue cooking until golden on the other side.
      Place the cooked tortilla in a tortilla warmer; continue rolling and 
      cooking the remaining dough.
    </li>
  </ol>
