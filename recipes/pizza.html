  </p>
  <p>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round,
     flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes,
     cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies,
     mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then 
     baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.
     A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes 
     pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.
