  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Wow, what a colorful Christmas Dish. I can't decide what the best part
    is. Is it the Ham, the Pineapple, or the skewered Maraschino Cherries?
  </p>
  <p>Ham is pork from a leg cut that has been preserved by wet or dry
    curing, with or without smoking.[1] As a processed meat, the term
    "ham" includes both whole cuts of meat and ones that have been
    mechanically formed. 
  </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 12 pound bone-in ham</li>
    <li>1.5 cups whole cloves</li>
    <li>1 20 oz can pineapple rings in heavy syrup</li>
    <li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 12 fl oz can lemon-lime flavored carbonated soda</li>
    <li>1 4 oz jar chopped maraschino cherries</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F</li>
    <li>Place ham in a roasting pan. Score the rind of the ham with a
      diamond pattern. Press a clove into the center of each diamond.
      Drain the juice from the pineapple rings into a medium bowl,
      and stir in the brown sugar and lemon-lime soda. Coat
      the ham with this mixture. Arrange the pineapple rings over the 
      outside of the ham. Place a maraschino cherry in the center of
      each pineapple ring, and secure with a toothpick.</li>
    <li>Bake uncovered for 4 to 5 hours, basting frequently with the
      juices, until the internal temperature of the ham is 160 degrees
      F (72 degrees C). Be sure the meat thermometer is not touching the
      bone. Remove toothpicks before serving.
    </li>
  </ol>
